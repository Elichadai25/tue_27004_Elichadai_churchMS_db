# Phase II: BPMN Diagram Explanation – Member Registration & Event Management
This BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagram models the Member Registration and Event Management process in a Church Management System. It uses four swimlanes to represent the key actors: Member, Church Staff, Database, and Event System. The purpose is to visualize how members are registered and engaged in events through a structured, MIS-supported workflow.

The process begins when a new member completes and submits a digital registration form. The form is reviewed by church staff to decide whether to approve or reject the registration. If approved, the member's data is stored in the centralized database, and they are assigned to a relevant ministry or group.

Once registered, the member can sign up for upcoming church events. The event system checks for available slots, updates the event participation data, and synchronizes with the database. This enables staff to monitor attendance, engagement, and resource planning.

✅ How This Supports MIS Functions
Automation: Replaces manual registration with digital forms.

Data Centralization: Member and event data are stored in one system.

Decision-Making: Staff can use real-time data to assign members and manage events.

Efficiency: Reduces delays and improves communication between departments.

This BPMN process improves organizational efficiency, streamlines operations, and ensures the church leadership has accurate, timely information — all of which are core objectives of Management Information Systems (MIS).
