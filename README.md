# Problem Definition:
Managing church operations (member records, donations, events, and volunteer coordination) is time-consuming and prone to errors.
Many churches rely on spreadsheets or manual records, leading to inefficiency and data inconsistency.
# Context:
This system will be used by churches to streamline administrative tasks, ensuring accurate record-keeping and automation of processes.
# Target Users:
Church administrators, pastors, and members who need access to services like event registrations and donation tracking.
# ðŸ“Œ Problem Summary â€“ Church Management System
Traditional church management often relies on manual paperwork, fragmented tools, and informal tracking methods. This creates operational bottlenecks, data inconsistency, and limited oversight across essential functions such as membership tracking, event planning, donations, and volunteer coordination.

To address these challenges, this project proposes a fully integrated Church Management System built using Oracle PL/SQL. The system is designed to centralize core activities in a relational database environment, providing automated workflows, accurate recordkeeping, and robust access control.

# Key features include:

Membership and attendance tracking

Event and service scheduling

Secure donation logging with audit trails

Volunteer role assignments and task management

Advanced business logic via procedures, functions, triggers, and packages

Rule enforcement (e.g., restricted operations on weekdays and holidays)

Real-time auditing and user activity monitoring

This project not only improves administrative efficiency but also enhances data integrity, security, and transparencyâ€”ensuring a scalable solution for modern church operations.
